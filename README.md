# A-New-Benchmark-Dataset-for-Arabic-Fake-News-Detection
One of the problems faced concerning Arabic fake news detection is the scarcity of Arabic datasets. We believe it is important to available a dataset is written in the Arabic language explicitly created for this domain. The existing studies of Arabic fake news detection are limited because most of the dataset has not been available to access for research. We have built for the purpose of fake news detection the dataset of Arabic Fake News Tweets. 

# Dataset collection

Only tweets content news in the Arabic language were collected from October 2020 until June 2021.

We present a dataset AFNT: Arabic Fake News Tweets of 5,165 tweets. These tweets were collected directly from Twitter API by using Tweepy API.

We used two fact-checking accounts in Twitter to get classify news for real news and fake news were Anti-rumors Authority and Misbar.

We used query texts to be given to the API to limit the stream of tweets got for each real and fake news post.

The id_tweets.txt file contains a collection of AFNT tweets IDs only, and the id_label_tweets.csv file contains the dataset of already annotated tweets ids.
 
For retrieving, the full object of the tweets consider the following tools Hydrator and Twarc.
