# A-New-Benchmark-Dataset-for-Arabic-Fake-News-Detection
One of the problems faced concerning Arabic fake news detection is the scarcity of Arabic datasets. We believe it is important to available a dataset is written in the Arabic language explicitly created for this domain. The existing studies of Arabic fake news detection are limited because most of the dataset has not been available to access for research. We have built for the purpose of fake news detection the dataset of Arabic Fake News Tweets.
